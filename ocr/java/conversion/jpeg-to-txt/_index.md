1.  Create an instance of AsposeOcr class
1.  Call AsposeOCR.recognizeImage method
1.  Pass the JPEG file path as parameter
1.  AsposeOCR.RecognizeLine returns a String with recognized text
1.  Convert String to TXT file, if required

 Aspose.OCR is an OCR API. Developers can easily perform image to text conversion and optical character recognition. API is capable to read multiple characters, different styles and fonts. API also supports multiple image formats. Its a standalone API and does not require any external software installation.

A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image.  The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality. JPEG image file format was standardized by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and, hence, the name JPEG. The format has been the choice of storing and transmitting photographic images on the web. Almost all Operating systems now have viewers that support visualization of JPEG images, which are often stored with JPG extension as well. Even the web browsers support visualization of JPEG images.

A file with .TXT extension represents a text document that contains plain text in the form of lines. Paragraphs in a text document are recognized by carriage returns and are used for better arrangement of file contents. A standard text document can be opened in any text editor or word processing application on different operating systems. All the text contained in such a file is in human-readable format and represented by sequence of characters.
