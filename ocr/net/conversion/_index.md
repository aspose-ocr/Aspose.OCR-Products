Extracting text from images of various formats including JPG, BMP, TIFF, PNG, and others as well as in different languages is easy by integrating .NET OCR API. Programmers can easily integrate the code within their **OCR converter app** for working with any text fonts, page layouts and styles. As of API automatic document layout detection and skew correction feature, conversion provides the best recognition results.

To convert images to text via any .NET based OCR software, process is simple. Create [AsposeOcr class](https://apireference.aspose.com/ocr/net/aspose.ocr/asposeocr) instance, then using the same instance to call its relevant [RecognizeImage Method](https://apireference.aspose.com/ocr/net/aspose.ocr.asposeocr/recognizeimage/methods/4) by providing the relevant image either BMP, GIF, JPG etc. RecognizeImage function will parse the image and returns the extracted text in form of string. Developers can easily store this string text into a string variable or can write to file or print via console, depending on their application nature. Programmers can also use [RecognizeLine](https://apireference.aspose.com/ocr/net/aspose.ocr/asposeocr/methods/recognizeline) to perform the OCR on images having single line of text. Same code detects the text of any supported language.
