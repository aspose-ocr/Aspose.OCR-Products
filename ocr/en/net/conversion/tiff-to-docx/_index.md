Aspose.OCR for .NET is a powerful yet easy-to-use and cost-effective library for converting TIFF images to DOCX documents. Supporting 26 languages based on Latin, Cyrillic and Chinese, its state-of-the-art optical character recognition engine provides superior recognition speed and accuracy, while isolating you from formulas, neural networks, and other complex technical details. It allows you to add OCR functionality to your .NET applications in less than 10 lines of code.

[Aspose.OCR for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/ocr/net) 
 processes scanned images or even smartphone photos in TIFF format and creates TIFF documents containing recognized text. To add it to your project, you just need to install the *Aspose.OCR* 
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.ocr) 
 package in your project with the following command:

With .NET OCR and just a few lines of code, you can create full-featured application that converts an TIFF image to DOCX document:

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Create an instance of AsposeOcr class
+ Call AsposeOCR.RecognizeImage method
+ Pass the TIFF file path as parameter
+ AsposeOCR.RecognizeImage returns a String or file of DOCX type

TIFF or TIF, Tagged Image File Format, represents raster images that are meant for usage on a variety of devices that comply with this file format standard. It is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color and full-color image data in several color spaces. It supports lossy as well as lossless compression schemes to choose between space and time for applications using the format. The format is extensible and has underwent several revisions that allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private or special-purpose information. The format is not machine dependent and is free from bounds like processor, operating system, or file systems.

DOCX is a well-known format for Microsoft Word documents. Introduced from 2007 with the release of Microsoft Office 2007, the structure of this new Document format was changed from plain binary to a combination of XML and binary files. Docx files can be opened with Word 2007 and lateral versions but not with the earlier versions of MS Word which support DOC file extensions.
