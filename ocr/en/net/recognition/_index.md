        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text whatIsFormat1="What is areas with text detection" >}}
Areas with text detection refers to the ability of neural models to identify and locate regions within an image or document that contain textual content. These models are designed to accurately detect and delineate areas such as paragraphs, lines, or individual words.

With areas with text detection, customers can leverage the power of neural models to automatically identify and extract textual information from various sources, including scanned documents, images, or PDF files. By analyzing the visual patterns and structural elements of the content, these models can accurately determine the boundaries of text blocks within the given input.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text whatIsFormat1="What is skew detection" >}}
By utilizing advanced computer vision algorithms, our API can automatically detect and quantify the skew angle of an image. This information can be used in various applications such as document scanning, optical character recognition (OCR), and image analysis. Correcting the skew of an image can enhance its visual appearance and improve the accuracy of subsequent image processing tasks.
Simply provide the image as input, and the API will return the angle of skew, allowing you to apply the necessary transformations to align the image correctly.
