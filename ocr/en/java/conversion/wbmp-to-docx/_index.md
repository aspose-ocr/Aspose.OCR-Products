[Aspose.Imaging for Java](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/java) 
 processes scanned images or even smartphone photos in WBMP format and creates WBMP documents containing recognized text. To add it to your project, you just need to get *Aspose.OCR* 
[Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-imaging) or specify Aspose Maven Repository configuration 
and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the _pom.xml_. For Graddle, Ivy, Sbt examples check out our [repository](https://repository.aspose.com/ocr/).

With Java OCR and just a few lines of code, you can create full-featured application that converts an WBMP image to DOCX document:

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Create an instance of AsposeOcr class
+ Call AsposeOCR.RecognizePage method
+ Pass the WBMP file path as parameter
+ AsposeOCR.RecognizePage returns a String or file of DOCX type

Before running the example, make sure that Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) 6.0 (1.6) or later is installed on your system.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

- JDK 1.6 or higher is installed.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="" offSpacer="true" %}}

```java

 //Create API instance
 AsposeOCR api = new AsposeOCR();

 //Prepare rectangles with texts.
 ArrayList rectArray = new ArrayList();

 rectArray.add(new Rectangle(138, 352, 2033, 537));
 rectArray.add(new Rectangle(147, 890, 2033, 1157));

 String result = api.RecognizePage("srcImage.png", rectArray);
 System.out.println("Result with rect: " + result);

WBMP is a monochrome graphics file format optimized for mobile computing devices. 
WBMP images are monochrome (black & white) so that the image size is kept to a minimum. A black pixel is denoted by 0 and a white pixel is denoted by 1.

DOCX is a well-known format for Microsoft Word documents. Introduced from 2007 with the release of Microsoft Office 2007, the structure of this new Document format was changed from plain binary to a combination of XML and binary files. Docx files can be opened with Word 2007 and lateral versions but not with the earlier versions of MS Word which support DOC file extensions.
