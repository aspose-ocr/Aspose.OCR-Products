Aspose.OCR for Java is a powerful yet easy-to-use and cost-effective library for converting JP2 images to XLSX documents. Supporting 26 languages based on Latin, Cyrillic and Chinese, its state-of-the-art optical character recognition engine provides superior recognition speed and accuracy, while isolating you from formulas, neural networks, and other complex technical details. It allows you to add OCR functionality to your Java applications in less than 10 lines of code.

[Aspose.OCR for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/ocr/net) 
 processes scanned images or even smartphone photos in JP2 format and creates JP2 documents containing recognized text. To add it to your project, you just need to install the *Aspose.OCR* 
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.ocr) 
 package in your project with the following command:

With Java OCR and just a few lines of code, you can create full-featured application that converts an JP2 image to XLSX document:

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Create an instance of AsposeOcr class
+ Call AsposeOCR.RecognizePage method
+ Pass the JP2 file path as parameter
+ AsposeOCR.RecognizePage returns a String or file of XLSX type

Before running the example, make sure that Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) 6.0 (1.6) or later is installed on your system.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

- JDK 1.6 or higher is installed.

```java

 //Create API instance
 AsposeOCR api = new AsposeOCR();

 //Prepare rectangles with texts.
 ArrayList rectArray = new ArrayList();

 rectArray.add(new Rectangle(138, 352, 2033, 537));
 rectArray.add(new Rectangle(147, 890, 2033, 1157));

 String result = api.RecognizePage("srcImage.png", rectArray);
 System.out.println("Result with rect: " + result);

JPEG 2000 (JP2) is an image coding system and state-of-the-art image compression standard. Designed, using wavelet technology JPEG 2000 can code lossless content in any quality at once. Moreover, without any substantial penalty in coding efficiency, JPEG 2000 have the capability to access and decode the same content efficaciously into a variety of other resolutions and qualities. The code streams in JPEG 2000 is significantly scalable having regions of interest that provide the facility for spatial random access. Possessing Up to 16384 diverse components with the dimensions in terapixels, and precision that can be high as 38 bits/sample.

XLSX is well-known format for Microsoft Excel documents that was introduced by Microsoft with the release of Microsoft Office 2007. Based on structure organized according to the Open Packaging Conventions as outlined in Part 2 of the OOXML standard ECMA-376, the new format is a zip package that contains a number of XML files. The underlying structure and files can be examined by simply unzipping the .xlsx file.
