[Aspose.Imaging for Java](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/java) 
 processes scanned images or even smartphone photos in PNG format and creates PNG documents containing recognized text. To add it to your project, you just need to get *Aspose.OCR* 
[Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-imaging) or specify Aspose Maven Repository configuration 
and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the _pom.xml_. For Graddle, Ivy, Sbt examples check out our [repository](https://repository.aspose.com/ocr/).

With Java OCR and just a few lines of code, you can create full-featured application that converts an PNG image to Searchable PDF document:

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Create an instance of AsposeOcr class
+ Call AsposeOCR.RecognizePage method
+ Pass the PNG file path as parameter
+ AsposeOCR.RecognizePage returns a String or file of Searchable PDF type

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

Before running the example, make sure that Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) 6.0 (1.6) or later is installed on your system.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

- JDK 1.6 or higher is installed.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="" offSpacer="true" %}}

```java

 //Create API instance
 AsposeOCR api = new AsposeOCR();

 //Prepare rectangles with texts.
 ArrayList rectArray = new ArrayList();

 rectArray.add(new Rectangle(138, 352, 2033, 537));
 rectArray.add(new Rectangle(147, 890, 2033, 1157));

 String result = api.RecognizePage("srcImage.png", rectArray);
 System.out.println("Result with rect: " + result);

PNG, Portable Network Graphics, refers to a type of raster image file format that use loseless compression. This file format was created as a replacement of Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and has no copyright limitations. However, PNG file format does not support animations. PNG file format supports loseless image compression that makes it popular among its users. With the passage of time, PNG has evolved as one of the mostly used image file format. Almost all Operating Systems have support for opening PNG files. For example, Microsoft Windows viewer has the capability to open PNG files as the OS has by default the support available as part of installation.

Searchable PDF files retain the original scanned image for viewing, as well as OCR text in a hidden layer that can be used for full-text searches within a document or highlighting text for copy and paste operations.
Full OCR conversion to PDF, not including the original image, will never retain 100% of the original formatting, especially if the document has many images or a complex layout.
