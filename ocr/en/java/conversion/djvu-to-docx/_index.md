[Aspose.Imaging for Java](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/java) 
 processes scanned images or even smartphone photos in DJVU format and creates DJVU documents containing recognized text. To add it to your project, you just need to get *Aspose.OCR* 
[Aspose Maven Repository](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-imaging) or specify Aspose Maven Repository configuration 
and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the _pom.xml_. For Graddle, Ivy, Sbt examples check out our [repository](https://repository.aspose.com/ocr/).

With Java OCR and just a few lines of code, you can create full-featured application that converts an DJVU image to DOCX document:

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Create an instance of AsposeOcr class
+ Call AsposeOCR.RecognizePage method
+ Pass the DJVU file path as parameter
+ AsposeOCR.RecognizePage returns a String or file of DOCX type

```java

 //Create API instance
 AsposeOCR api = new AsposeOCR();

 //Prepare rectangles with texts.
 ArrayList rectArray = new ArrayList();

 rectArray.add(new Rectangle(138, 352, 2033, 537));
 rectArray.add(new Rectangle(147, 890, 2033, 1157));

 String result = api.RecognizePage("srcImage.png", rectArray);
 System.out.println("Result with rect: " + result);

DjVu, pronounced as “déjà vu”, is a graphics file format intended for scanned documents and books especially those which contain the combination of text, drawings, images and photographs. It was developed by AT&T Labs. It uses multiple techniques like image layer separation of text and background images, progressive loading, arithmetic coding and lossy compression for bitonal images. Since DJVU file can contain compressed yet high-quality colour images, photographs, text, and drawings and can be saved in less space therefore, it's used on web as eBooks, manuals, newspapers, ancient documents, etc.

DOCX is a well-known format for Microsoft Word documents. Introduced from 2007 with the release of Microsoft Office 2007, the structure of this new Document format was changed from plain binary to a combination of XML and binary files. Docx files can be opened with Word 2007 and lateral versions but not with the earlier versions of MS Word which support DOC file extensions.
