Aspose.OCR for Java is a powerful yet easy-to-use and cost-effective library for converting JPEG images to Searchable PDF documents. Supporting 26 languages based on Latin, Cyrillic and Chinese, its state-of-the-art optical character recognition engine provides superior recognition speed and accuracy, while isolating you from formulas, neural networks, and other complex technical details. It allows you to add OCR functionality to your Java applications in less than 10 lines of code.

[Aspose.OCR for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/ocr/net) 
 processes scanned images or even smartphone photos in JPEG format and creates JPEG documents containing recognized text. To add it to your project, you just need to install the *Aspose.OCR* 
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.ocr) 
 package in your project with the following command:

```xml

 <dependency>
 <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
 <artifactId>aspose-ocr</artifactId>
 <version>22.5</version>

With Java OCR and just a few lines of code, you can create full-featured application that converts an JPEG image to Searchable PDF document:

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Create an instance of AsposeOcr class
+ Call AsposeOCR.RecognizePage method
+ Pass the JPEG file path as parameter
+ AsposeOCR.RecognizePage returns a String or file of Searchable PDF type

Before running the example, make sure that Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) 6.0 (1.6) or later is installed on your system.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

- JDK 1.6 or higher is installed.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="This sample code shows JPEG to Searchable PDF Java Conversion" offSpacer="true" %}}

```java

 //Create API instance
 AsposeOCR api = new AsposeOCR();

 //Prepare rectangles with texts.
 ArrayList rectArray = new ArrayList();

 rectArray.add(new Rectangle(138, 352, 2033, 537));
 rectArray.add(new Rectangle(147, 890, 2033, 1157));

 String result = api.RecognizePage("srcImage.png", rectArray);
 System.out.println("Result with rect: " + result);

A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image. The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality.

Searchable PDF files retain the original scanned image for viewing, as well as OCR text in a hidden layer that can be used for full-text searches within a document or highlighting text for copy and paste operations.
Full OCR conversion to PDF, not including the original image, will never retain 100% of the original formatting, especially if the document has many images or a complex layout.
