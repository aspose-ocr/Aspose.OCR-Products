Aspose.OCR for Java is a powerful yet easy-to-use and cost-effective library for converting GIF images to TXT documents. Supporting 26 languages based on Latin, Cyrillic and Chinese, its state-of-the-art optical character recognition engine provides superior recognition speed and accuracy, while isolating you from formulas, neural networks, and other complex technical details. It allows you to add OCR functionality to your Java applications in less than 10 lines of code.

[Aspose.OCR for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/ocr/net) 
 processes scanned images or even smartphone photos in GIF format and creates GIF documents containing recognized text. To add it to your project, you just need to install the *Aspose.OCR* 
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.ocr) 
 package in your project with the following command:

With Java OCR and just a few lines of code, you can create full-featured application that converts an GIF image to TXT document:

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Create an instance of AsposeOcr class
+ Call AsposeOCR.RecognizePage method
+ Pass the GIF file path as parameter
+ AsposeOCR.RecognizePage returns a String or file of TXT type

Before running the example, make sure that Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) 6.0 (1.6) or later is installed on your system.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

- JDK 1.6 or higher is installed.

```java

 //Create API instance
 AsposeOCR api = new AsposeOCR();

 //Prepare rectangles with texts.
 ArrayList rectArray = new ArrayList();

 rectArray.add(new Rectangle(138, 352, 2033, 537));
 rectArray.add(new Rectangle(147, 890, 2033, 1157));

 String result = api.RecognizePage("srcImage.png", rectArray);
 System.out.println("Result with rect: " + result);

A GIF or Graphical Interchange Format is a type of highly compressed image. Owned by Unisys, GIF uses the LZW compression algorithm that does not degrade the image quality. For each image GIF typically allow up to 8 bits per pixel and up to 256 colours are allowed across the image. In contrast to a JPEG image, which can display up to 16 million colours and fairly touches the limits of the human eye. Back when the internet emerged, GIFs remained the best choice because they required low bandwidth and compatible for the graphics that consume solid areas of colour. An animated GIF combines numerous images or frames into a single file and displays them in a sequence to generate an animated clip or a short video. The colour limitations are up to 256 for each frame and are likely to be the least suitable for reproducing other images and photographs with colour gradient.

A file with .TXT extension represents a text document that contains plain text in the form of lines. Paragraphs in a text document are recognized by carriage returns and are used for better arrangement of file contents. A standard text document can be opened in any text editor or word processing application on different operating systems. All the text contained in such a file is in human-readable format and represented by sequence of characters.
