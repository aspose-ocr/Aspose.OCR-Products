[Aspose.Imaging for Java](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/java) 
 processes scanned images or even smartphone photos in PDF format and creates PDF documents containing recognized text. To add it to your project, you just need to get *Aspose.OCR* 
[Aspose Maven Repository](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-imaging) or specify Aspose Maven Repository configuration 
and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the _pom.xml_. For Graddle, Ivy, Sbt examples check out our [repository](https://repository.aspose.com/ocr/).

With C++ OCR and just a few lines of code, you can create full-featured application that converts an PDF image to PDF document:

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Create an instance of AsposeOcr class
+ Call AsposeOCR.asposeocr_page() method
+ Pass the PDF file path as parameter
+ AsposeOCR.asposeocr_page returns a String or file of PDF type

Before running the example, make sure that [Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime/) 1.7.0 or above is added to the project. It should be automatically installed if you install Aspose.OCR via NuGet Package Manager.

```cpp

std::string img_path = "../srcSample.png";

// Prepare buffer for result (in symbols, len_byte = len * sizeof(wchar_t))
const size_t len = 4096;

wchar_t bfr[len] = { 0 };

size_t result = aspose::ocr::page(image_path.c_str(), bfr, len);

//Print result
std::wcout << bfr << L"\n";

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. The PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
