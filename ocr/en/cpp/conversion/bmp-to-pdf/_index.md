Aspose.OCR for C++ is a powerful yet easy-to-use and cost-effective library for converting BMP images to PDF documents. Supporting 26 languages based on Latin, Cyrillic and Chinese, its state-of-the-art optical character recognition engine provides superior recognition speed and accuracy, while isolating you from formulas, neural networks, and other complex technical details. It allows you to add OCR functionality to your C++ applications in less than 10 lines of code.

[Aspose.OCR for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/ocr/net) 
 processes scanned images or even smartphone photos in BMP format and creates BMP documents containing recognized text. To add it to your project, you just need to install the *Aspose.OCR* 
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.ocr) 
 package in your project with the following command:

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Package Manager Console Command" offSpacer="true" %}}

```cs

  PM> Install-Package Aspose.OCR

```

With C++ OCR and just a few lines of code, you can create full-featured application that converts an BMP image to PDF document:

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Create an instance of AsposeOcr class
+ Call AsposeOCR.asposeocr_page() method
+ Pass the BMP file path as parameter
+ AsposeOCR.asposeocr_page returns a String or file of PDF type

Before running the example, make sure that [Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime/) 1.7.0 or above is added to the project. It should be automatically installed if you install Aspose.OCR via NuGet Package Manager.

```cpp

// Prepare buffer for result (in symbols, len_byte = len * sizeof(wchar_t))
const size_t len = 4096;

wchar_t bfr[len] = { 0 };

size_t result = aspose::ocr::page(image_path.c_str(), bfr, len);

//Print result

Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images  in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. The PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
