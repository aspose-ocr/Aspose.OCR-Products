Aspose.OCR for C++ is a powerful yet easy-to-use and cost-effective library for converting DJVU images to TXT documents. Supporting 26 languages based on Latin, Cyrillic and Chinese, its state-of-the-art optical character recognition engine provides superior recognition speed and accuracy, while isolating you from formulas, neural networks, and other complex technical details. It allows you to add OCR functionality to your C++ applications in less than 10 lines of code.

[Aspose.OCR for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/ocr/net) 
 processes scanned images or even smartphone photos in DJVU format and creates DJVU documents containing recognized text. To add it to your project, you just need to install the *Aspose.OCR* 
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.ocr) 
 package in your project with the following command:

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Package Manager Console Command" offSpacer="true" %}}

```cs

  PM> Install-Package Aspose.OCR

```

With C++ OCR and just a few lines of code, you can create full-featured application that converts an DJVU image to TXT document:

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Create an instance of AsposeOcr class
+ Call AsposeOCR.asposeocr_page() method
+ Pass the DJVU file path as parameter
+ AsposeOCR.asposeocr_page returns a String or file of TXT type

Before running the example, make sure that [Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime/) 1.7.0 or above is added to the project. It should be automatically installed if you install Aspose.OCR via NuGet Package Manager.

DjVu, pronounced as “déjà vu”, is a graphics file format intended for scanned documents and books especially those which contain the combination of text, drawings, images and photographs. It was developed by AT&T Labs. It uses multiple techniques like image layer separation of text and background images, progressive loading, arithmetic coding and lossy compression for bitonal images. Since DJVU file can contain compressed yet high-quality colour images, photographs, text, and drawings and can be saved in less space therefore, it's used on web as eBooks, manuals, newspapers, ancient documents, etc.

A file with .TXT extension represents a text document that contains plain text in the form of lines. Paragraphs in a text document are recognized by carriage returns and are used for better arrangement of file contents. A standard text document can be opened in any text editor or word processing application on different operating systems. All the text contained in such a file is in human-readable format and represented by sequence of characters.
