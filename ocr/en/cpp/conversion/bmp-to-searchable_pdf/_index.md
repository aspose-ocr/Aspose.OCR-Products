[Aspose.Imaging for Java](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/java) 
 processes scanned images or even smartphone photos in BMP format and creates BMP documents containing recognized text. To add it to your project, you just need to get *Aspose.OCR* 
[Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-imaging) or specify Aspose Maven Repository configuration 
and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the _pom.xml_. For Graddle, Ivy, Sbt examples check out our [repository](https://repository.aspose.com/ocr/).

With C++ OCR and just a few lines of code, you can create full-featured application that converts an BMP image to Searchable PDF document:

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Create an instance of AsposeOcr class
+ Call AsposeOCR.asposeocr_page() method
+ Pass the BMP file path as parameter
+ AsposeOCR.asposeocr_page returns a String or file of Searchable PDF type

Before running the example, make sure that [Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime/) 1.7.0 or above is added to the project. It should be automatically installed if you install Aspose.OCR via NuGet Package Manager.

```cpp

std::string img_path = "../srcSample.png";

// Prepare buffer for result (in symbols, len_byte = len * sizeof(wchar_t))
const size_t len = 4096;

wchar_t bfr[len] = { 0 };

size_t result = aspose::ocr::page(image_path.c_str(), bfr, len);

//Print result
std::wcout << bfr << L"\n";

Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images  in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.

Searchable PDF files retain the original scanned image for viewing, as well as OCR text in a hidden layer that can be used for full-text searches within a document or highlighting text for copy and paste operations.
Full OCR conversion to PDF, not including the original image, will never retain 100% of the original formatting, especially if the document has many images or a complex layout.
