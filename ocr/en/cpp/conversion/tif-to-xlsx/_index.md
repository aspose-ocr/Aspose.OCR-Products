Aspose.OCR for C++ is a powerful yet easy-to-use and cost-effective library for converting TIF images to XLSX documents. Supporting 26 languages based on Latin, Cyrillic and Chinese, its state-of-the-art optical character recognition engine provides superior recognition speed and accuracy, while isolating you from formulas, neural networks, and other complex technical details. It allows you to add OCR functionality to your C++ applications in less than 10 lines of code.

[Aspose.OCR for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/ocr/net) 
 processes scanned images or even smartphone photos in TIF format and creates TIF documents containing recognized text. To add it to your project, you just need to install the *Aspose.OCR* 
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.ocr) 
 package in your project with the following command:

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Package Manager Console Command" offSpacer="true" %}}

```cs

  PM> Install-Package Aspose.OCR

```

With C++ OCR and just a few lines of code, you can create full-featured application that converts an TIF image to XLSX document:

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Create an instance of AsposeOcr class
+ Call AsposeOCR.asposeocr_page() method
+ Pass the TIF file path as parameter
+ AsposeOCR.asposeocr_page returns a String or file of XLSX type

Before running the example, make sure that [Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime/) 1.7.0 or above is added to the project. It should be automatically installed if you install Aspose.OCR via NuGet Package Manager.

const size_t len = 4096;

TIFF or TIF, Tagged Image File Format, represents raster images that are meant for usage on a variety of devices that comply with this file format standard. It is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color and full-color image data in several color spaces. It supports lossy as well as lossless compression schemes to choose between space and time for applications using the format. The format is extensible and has underwent several revisions that allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private or special-purpose information. The format is not machine dependent and is free from bounds like processor, operating system, or file systems.

XLSX is well-known format for Microsoft Excel documents that was introduced by Microsoft with the release of Microsoft Office 2007. Based on structure organized according to the Open Packaging Conventions as outlined in Part 2 of the OOXML standard ECMA-376, the new format is a zip package that contains a number of XML files. The underlying structure and files can be examined by simply unzipping the .xlsx file.
