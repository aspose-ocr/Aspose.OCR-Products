Conversion is need for business applications for recognizing OCR for making the text editable, reading codes from vouchers and self-service stores etc. Converting different images BMP, GIF, JPG, PNG to Text of various languages is simple by integrating the C++ library. Programmers can easily use the code for extracting single line text, whole page text, text within a particular area and more for any OCR application having the best recognition results and can handle any text fonts, page layouts and styles.

To extract text from images via C++ OCR API, Process depends on scenario for using the relevant function to **perform OCR** on page, or image containing a single line. API provides [page](https://apireference.aspose.com/ocr/cpp/groupAspose#ga12fd25c079745617c8acbf38f61e44cf)(const char * image_path, wchar_t * buffer, size_t buffer_size), [pages_multi](https://apireference.aspose.com/ocr/cpp/groupAspose#ga53d926b03a01f388d59801979e21b12c)(const char *path_to_recognize, wchar_t *buffer, size_t buffer_size, RecognitionSettings settings), [line](https://apireference.aspose.com/ocr/cpp/groupAspose#ga00aec23aeebdb45943cfc6db33539540)(const char *image_path, wchar_t *buffer, size_t buffer_size) and more. Here is list of all [OCR functions](https://apireference.aspose.com/ocr/cpp/groupAspose) that developers can perform easily. Below are the code examples for performing ocr on a page and line.
